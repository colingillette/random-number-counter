#Random Number Counter

##Purpose

This is a random number generator made for an introductory C# class. It will generate a user-specified number of random integers from 0-99. It will then display a message box showing how many instances there were in the five ranges of 20 numbers available. 

##Usage

For instance, if you generated 20 numbers, your output might look like: "4, 5, 3, 6, 2." Signfying 0-19 had 4 isntances, 20-39 had 5 isntances, etc. 

To generate the numbers, you will put the number of integers you would like to generate in the textbox, and then hit save file to create a local save location.

To view output, simply hit open file and open the previously generated file.
